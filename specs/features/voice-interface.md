# Voice Interface Feature Specification

**Feature**: Voice-First Conversation Interface  
**Priority**: Phase 2 (Post-MVP)  
**Complexity**: High  
**Timeline**: 3-4 months  

## Problem Statement

During relationship conflicts, typing on a phone feels artificial and creates barriers to authentic emotional expression. Partners need to communicate with Ki naturally through voice, especially during heated moments when typing is impractical or emotionally disconnected.

## User Stories

### Primary Users: Couples in Conflict
- **As a user in emotional distress**, I want to speak to Ki naturally so that I can express my feelings without the barrier of typing
- **As a couple during an argument**, we want to both talk to Ki simultaneously so that we can get real-time mediation support
- **As a user driving or multitasking**, I want hands-free access to Ki so that I can get relationship support whenever I need it

### Secondary Users: Accessibility
- **As a user with visual impairments**, I want voice interaction so that I can fully access Ki's relationship guidance
- **As a user with motor disabilities**, I want speech input so that typing limitations don't prevent me from using Ki

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Speech-to-Text (STT)
```typescript
interface SpeechToText {
  startListening(): Promise<AudioStream>;
  processAudio(stream: AudioStream): Promise<TranscriptionResult>;
  stopListening(): Promise<FinalTranscription>;
  configureLive(options: LiveTranscriptionOptions): void;
}

interface TranscriptionResult {
  text: string;
  confidence: number;
  isFinal: boolean;
  timestamp: Date;
  emotions?: EmotionMarkers;
}
```

**Implementation Options**:
- **Primary**: Deepgram for high accuracy and emotion detection
- **Fallback**: OpenAI Whisper for cost optimization
- **Browser**: Web Speech API for offline capability

### 2. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
```typescript
interface TextToSpeech {
  synthesizeVoice(text: string, options: VoiceOptions): Promise<AudioBuffer>;
  streamSpeech(text: AsyncGenerator<string>): AsyncGenerator<AudioChunk>;
  configureVoice(personality: VoicePersonality): VoiceSettings;
}

interface VoiceOptions {
  personality: 'empathetic' | 'calm' | 'encouraging';
  speed: number; // 0.5 - 2.0
  emotion?: EmotionalTone;
  gender?: 'female' | 'male' | 'neutral';
}
```

**Implementation Strategy**:
- **Primary**: Hume AI Octave for emotional voice synthesis
- **Fallback**: ElevenLabs for high-quality voice cloning
- **Standard**: OpenAI TTS for cost-effective synthesis

### 3. Real-time Audio Processing
```typescript
interface AudioProcessor {
  detectEmotions(audioBuffer: AudioBuffer): Promise<EmotionProfile>;
  removeNoise(audioStream: AudioStream): Promise<CleanAudioStream>;
  handleInterruptions(currentSpeech: AudioStream): Promise<InterruptionHandler>;
  manageTurnTaking(speakers: SpeakerIdentification[]): Promise<ConversationFlow>;
}
```

### 4. Multi-User Voice Handling
```typescript
interface MultiUserVoice {
  identifySpeakers(audioStream: AudioStream): Promise<SpeakerMap>;
  separateChannels(mixedAudio: AudioBuffer): Promise<SeparatedChannels>;
  handleSimultaneousSpeech(channels: AudioChannel[]): Promise<ProcessingStrategy>;
  maintainContext(speakerId: string, message: TranscribedMessage): Promise<UserContext>;
}
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Frontend Voice Components
```typescript
// Voice interface component
const VoiceInterface: React.FC = () => {
  const { isListening, transcript, startListening, stopListening } = useSpeechToText();
  const { speak, isSpeaking } = useTextToSpeech();
  const { emotions } = useVoiceEmotionAnalysis();
  
  return (
    <div className="voice-interface">
      <VoiceVisualizer isListening={isListening} emotions={emotions} />
      <LiveTranscript text={transcript} />
      <VoiceControls onStart={startListening} onStop={stopListening} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 2. Backend Audio Processing
```typescript
// Audio processing service
class AudioService {
  async processVoiceMessage(audioBuffer: ArrayBuffer, userId: string): Promise<VoiceResponse> {
    // 1. Transcribe speech to text
    const transcription = await this.speechToText.transcribe(audioBuffer);
    
    // 2. Analyze emotional content
    const emotions = await this.emotionAnalysis.analyzeVoice(audioBuffer);
    
    // 3. Generate AI response
    const response = await this.aiService.generateResponse({
      text: transcription.text,
      emotions,
      userId,
      modality: 'voice'
    });
    
    // 4. Synthesize voice response
    const audioResponse = await this.textToSpeech.synthesize(response.text, {
      emotion: response.emotionalTone,
      personality: 'empathetic'
    });
    
    return {
      transcription,
      emotions,
      textResponse: response.text,
      audioResponse,
      timestamp: new Date()
    };
  }
}
```

// Real-time audio streaming
class VoiceStreamManager {
  private peerConnection: RTCPeerConnection;
  private audioProcessor: AudioWorkletNode;
  
  async startVoiceSession(userId: string): Promise<VoiceSession> {
    // Set up WebRTC connection for low-latency audio
    this.peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection(rtcConfig);
    
    // Configure audio processing worklet
    await this.setupAudioWorklet();
    
    // Start real-time transcription
    return this.initializeVoiceSession(userId);
  }
  
  private async setupAudioWorklet(): Promise<void> {
    const audioContext = new AudioContext();
    await audioContext.audioWorklet.addModule('/voice-processor.js');
