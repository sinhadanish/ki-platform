# Project Specifications Directory

**"The plan is the prompt"** - This directory contains the comprehensive specifications, plans, and requirements that drive development of the Ki platform.

## Purpose

The specs directory serves as the authoritative source for:
- Feature specifications and requirements
- Product roadmaps and planning documents
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- User stories and acceptance criteria
- API specifications and contracts

## Directory Structure

```

## Writing Effective Specifications

### 1. Feature Specifications
Each feature spec should include:
- **Problem Statement**: What problem does this solve?
- **User Stories**: Who needs this and why?
- **Technical Requirements**: How will it be implemented?
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How do we know it's done?
- **Dependencies**: What other features/systems are required?

### 2. API Specifications
Use OpenAPI 3.0 format for all API specifications:
- Complete endpoint documentation
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements
- Error handling specifications

### 3. Architecture Decisions
Document significant technical decisions using ADR format:
- Context and problem statement
- Options considered
- Decision rationale
- Consequences and trade-offs

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Assistants
1. Read relevant specs before implementing features
2. Ensure implementation matches specification requirements
3. Update specs when requirements evolve during development
4. Reference specs in code comments and documentation

### For Development Teams
1. Create detailed specs before starting development
2. Review and approve specs before implementation
3. Keep specs updated as requirements change
4. Use specs for QA and testing validation

## Quality Standards

- **Clarity**: Specifications should be unambiguous
- **Completeness**: Cover all functional and non-functional requirements
- **Testability**: Include measurable acceptance criteria
- **Maintainability**: Keep specs updated with changes

## Approval Process

1. **Draft**: Initial specification creation
2. **Review**: Team and stakeholder review
3. **Approved**: Final approval for implementation
4. **Implemented**: Marked as completed
5. **Deprecated**: Replaced by newer specifications
