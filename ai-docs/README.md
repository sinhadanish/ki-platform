# AI Documentation Directory

This directory contains persistent memory and reference documentation for AI coding assistants working on the Ki platform. It serves as a "memory palace" that enables rapid context establishment across multiple coding sessions.

## Directory Structure

- `api-references/` - Third-party API documentation and integration guides
- `patterns/` - Custom patterns, conventions, and implementation notes
- `architectures/` - System design and architectural decisions
- `integrations/` - External service configurations and setup guides
- `troubleshooting/` - Common issues and solutions
- `context-primers/` - Quick context establishment scripts

## Usage Guidelines

### For AI Assistants
- Read relevant files before starting any development task
- Use this documentation to understand project-specific patterns
- Reference API documentation for accurate integration code
- Update documentation when implementing new patterns

### For Developers
- Keep documentation updated with new integrations
- Document custom patterns and conventions
- Include troubleshooting notes for complex setup processes
- Use clear, actionable language for AI comprehension

## Key Principles

1. **Persistent Memory**: Documentation that survives across sessions
2. **Quick Context**: Enable rapid AI assistant onboarding
3. **Accurate Integration**: Prevent hallucination of API details
4. **Pattern Consistency**: Maintain coding standards across the platform
